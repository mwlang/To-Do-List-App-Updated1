Purpose:

6. Add Multiple Roles to Your User to Create an ‘Admin’
Goal: To set up multiple roles for each User in order to create an admin.
Steps:
 a. Add a an attribute of name(string) to your ‘user’ model.
 b. Create a new model called ‘role’ and create an additional model called ‘user_role.’  The ‘user_role’ model will be the join table. Use a many to many association so that a user has many user_roles, and a role has many user_roles. The user_role model should belong to both user and role.  
 c. Add a an attribute of admin(string) to your ‘role’ model.
 d. Create a method to check if a user is an admin in your ‘user’ model. You can use a method called ‘def admin?’
